# Citable, obtainable, unrunnable: recording where the reconstruction of a published comparison actually stops

Probe code, probe output, sweep results, figure code and manuscript source for an audit that records, rung by rung, where the reconstruction of a published acoustic-localisation comparison stops on an ordinary machine.

This repository has not been deposited in a public archive, so it has no persistent identifier yet. One will be recorded here when an archive exists.

## What is here

- `paper/tex/` — manuscript source. The abstract, the methods and the figure
  captions are separate files and each is self-contained.
- `paper/figs/` — the R code that draws every figure and emits every number the
  manuscript prints.
- `paper/evidence/` — the manifest binding each artifact to its SHA-256 digest.
- `data/` — the 14 artifacts the manifest names, at the bytes that
  were hashed.

## Not redistributed

The manuscript's evidence manifest binds one further artifact that this archive does not carry. No number in the manuscript is derived from that material; it is bound because the manuscript refers to the content, and held back for the reason below.

- The project's own working record of this direction. It is an internal narrative that names other directions, planning decisions and process labels, and the one number the manuscript took from it -- the size of the corpus that is not on disk -- is recorded first-hand in the inventory, which is redistributed. The figure code reads it from there.

## Rebuild

```bash
bash build.sh
```

The build re-hashes every artifact before reading it and stops if any byte has
moved. Figures and printed numbers are regenerated from those bytes rather than
transcribed, so the manuscript cannot quietly disagree with its own data.

Requires `python3`, `Rscript` with `digest`, `ggplot2`, `jsonlite`, `patchwork`
and `systemfonts`, and a TeX distribution with `latexmk`.
